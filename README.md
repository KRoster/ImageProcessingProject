# Extracting Forest Areas in Google Maps Aerial Images

**Kirstin Roster - NUSP: 11375819**

This project aims to identify forest areas in Google Maps aerial/satellite images by applying the following image processing methods: (i) noise/artifact reduction filtering, (ii) segmentation based on color and structure, and (iii) visualization (border) of identified forest areas. Additional analysis may include measuring forest coverage from the pixel share of identified forest areas, which I intend to compare with existing indicators of forest coverage (e.g. World Bank Development Indicators). 

Context:
Global forest coverage has declined continuously since at least 1992 due, for example, to economic exploration of the rainforest. Reducing deforestation is an important contributor to climate change mitigation, the first step of which is effective monitoring of forest areas. This project aims to contribute to monitoring efforts by demonstrating how forest areas can be identified using satellite imagery using an example region. Later implementations can be expanded globally and historically to monitor changes over time.
