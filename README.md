# Image Processing - Final Project
# Extracting Forest Areas in Google Maps Aerial Images

# Kirstin Roster - NUSP: 11375819

# This project aims to identify forest areas in Google Maps aerial/satellite images applying methods of image segmentation and preprocessing steps such as filtering for noise reduction. I intend to compare the results with existing indicators of forest coverage (e.g. World Bank Development Indicators). Global forest coverage has declined since at least 1992 due, for example, to economic exploration of the rainforest. Reducing deforestation is an important contributor to climate change mitigation, the first step of which is effective monitoring of forest areas. This project aims to contribute to this effort by demonstrating how forest areas can be identified using satellite imagery using a case country/region. Later implementations may be expanded globally and historically to monitor changes over time.
